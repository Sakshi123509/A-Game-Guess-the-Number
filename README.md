# A-Game-Guess-the-Number
It is a simple and interactive number guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range (e.g., 1 to 100). With each guess, the game provides feedback — whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct — making it both fun and educational!
